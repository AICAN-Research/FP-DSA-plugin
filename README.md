# DSA FAST-Pathology extension

## Requirements


## Installation


## Acknowledgements

The core was built based on [pyFAST](https://github.com/smistad/FAST), and the plugin was inspired by the plugins made for [MONAILabel](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/tree/main/plugins/dsa) and [HistomicsTK_PodoSighter](https://github.com/SarderLab/HistomicsTK_PodoSighter/tree/master/histomicstk/cli).

The plugin was made for the [Digital Slide Archive](https://github.com/DigitalSlideArchive/digital_slide_archive) which have developed an open and extremely robust and user-friendly archive web solution for large microscopy images. Building our methods on top of DSA was done with ease and credit to the developers such as [manthey](https://github.com/manthey) for addressing any issue and concerns we had at impressive speed!
